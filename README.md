# Tree-of-Life

**Tree-of-Life** is a _Python-written_ and _stand-alone_ **library** that configures the Python dependencies and the _executable files_ for Python-based and user-oriented projects.

As the name implies, it provides a _tree_ of routines that give _life_ to your project (inside user's computers) `:-)`.

It is designed to serve user-oriented projects, that is, projects that aim at a broad user audience that is not expected to have programming skills. With Tree-of-Life users can easily setup the host project in their computers.

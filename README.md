# Tree-of-Life

*Tree-of-Life* is a _Python-based_ and _stand-alone_ library that configures Python dependencies for user-oriented projects. It also configures the _executable_ files.

## Vision

After performing several workshops on [Farseer-NMR](https://github.com/Farseer-NMR/FarSeer-NMR), I found that software installation is one of the crucial bottle necks between user-developer interaction. When asking users to install a software, there is a clear difference between users with programming skills, regardless of the level, and users without any of these skills. For the later group, simple steps like installing [Anaconda] and configuring a [Python environment] are definitively not straightforward and can hinder users from using your software or even drive them away.

Therefore, when developing software for a community of users that are not expected (nor required) to have any programming skills, it is necessary to keep the installation process within the most universal standards as possible, and these have been, for decades:

1. download
1. unzip
1. click single file to install
1. click single file to run

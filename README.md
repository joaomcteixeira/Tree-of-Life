# Tree-of-Life

_version: 1.0.1_

**Tree-of-Life** is a _Python-written_ and _stand-alone_ **library** that installs the Python dependencies and configures the _executable files_ for Python-based and **user-oriented** projects, and keeps them updated.

As the name implies, it provides a _tree_ of routines that give _life_ to your project (inside user's computers) `:-)`.

It is designed to serve _user-oriented projects_, that is, projects that aim at a broad user audience that is not expected to have programming skills. With Tree-of-Life users can easily setup the host project in their computers.

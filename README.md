**Tree-of-Life** is a _Python-written_ and _stand-alone_ **library** that installs the Python dependencies, configures the _executable files_ and provides an updating interface for Python-based projects oriented for *non-developer* users. Reducing the task of installation and updating to simple *double-click* operations *(something that was so common in the past but which is becoming rare to find in most Scientific softwares today)*.

As the name implies, it provides a _tree_ of routines that give _life_ to your project (inside user's computers) `:-)`.

## Vision

Read [here](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tree-of-Life/blob/master/VISION.md) about the complete motivation and vision behind Tree-of-Life.

## Projects which have adopted Tree-of-Life

Hosting Tree-of-Life in a project does not prevent it being available through other sources, such as, Conda packages or PiPy. Some Scientific projects already use Tree-of-Life to manage their installation and updating routines:

- [Farseer-NMR](https://github.com/Farseer-NMR/FarSeer-NMR)
- [Tauren-MD](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tauren-MD)

## How to implement Tree-of-Life in your projects

If you are a software developer with Python-based or Python-dependent projects, and you wish to know how to implement Tree-of-Life in your project, find all information in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tree-of-Life/wiki) or in the `docs` folder. Implementing Tree-of-Life is *almost* as easy as copy+pasting a folder `;-)`.
